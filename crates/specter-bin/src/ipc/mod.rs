//! Operator IPC vocabulary — request/response shapes, diagnostic
//! projection, socket lifecycle, client verbs, human rendering.
//!
//! True leaf: nothing here imports [`crate::driver`]. The wire surface
//! lives here so an external CLI (today's in-bin client, a hypothetical
//! out-of-process tool tomorrow) could reuse the same vocabulary
//! without dragging in the daemon's runtime.
//!
//! Daemon-side IPC code — the kernel-fd owner ([`crate::driver::Hub`]),
//! per-conn state, verb dispatch, and engine-state projection — lives
//! under `crate::driver::ipc`. Direction is one-way: `driver::ipc`
//! consumes this module, never the reverse.
//!
//! # Submodules
//!
//! - [`protocol`] — wire-side request shape (`WireRequest`), response
//!   carriers (`ResponsePayload`, `StatusResponse`, `ListResponse`,
//!   `ShowResponse`), the `WireId` newtype, and the `WireErrorCode`
//!   closed-vocabulary enum.
//! - [`wire`] — `WireDiagnostic` (the exhaustive
//!   projection of every `specter_core::Diagnostic` variant),
//!   `WireTime`, and the per-core-type `Wire*` projections every
//!   variant transitively reaches.
//! - [`framing`] — `encode_line<T: InfallibleSerialize>` (the
//!   marker-bounded "build the wire-ready bytes" wrapper every
//!   production send path converges through) and `parse_strict<T>`
//!   (the round-trip unknown-field gate every incoming request /
//!   response is admitted through). Owns the LF-delimited framing
//!   contract single-source.
//! - [`resolve`] — socket-path resolution policy: one `resolve` →
//!   `Resolution` consumed two ways (daemon commits a path, client
//!   probes a cascade), the per-platform convention, explicit-override
//!   validation, and the `SocketSource` diagnostic vocabulary. Pure,
//!   env-injected.
//! - [`sockpath`] — UNIX-socket atomic-rename bind with 0600
//!   permissions, stale-socket recovery, and the drop-guard that
//!   unlinks the socket on graceful shutdown or panic.
//! - [`client`] — operator-facing client verbs.
//! - [`render`] — human-readable rendering for `-o human` output.
//!
//! # Visibility
//!
//! Every export is `pub(crate)`. Nothing here is `pub` — operator
//! clients ship inside the same binary, so the wire surface is an
//! implementation detail of the bin, not a published library
//! interface.
