/// is a typed state-machine move from [`PreFireBurst`] to [`PostFireBurst`]: the two sides have
/// disjoint valid mutators, valid timers, valid probe responses, and accumulator semantics.
/// Encoding the split at the type level means a field that has no post-fire consumer (e.g.
/// `forced`, `last_event_time`) cannot leak across the boundary by construction.
///
/// **Pre-fire** (`Batching | Verifying | Draining`): event-driven debounce window, in-flight verify
/// or self-stable / descendants-pending idle. Carries the event-provenance accumulator (`dirty`)
/// and the settle-deadline source of truth (`last_event_time`). Quiescence is folded by
/// [`quiescence_verdict`] at the dispatch — the engine's two observation channels (walker authority
/// C1, event-quiet witness C2, the `forced` bit) determine the verdict at the floor, so the burst
/// carries no per-sample fold state.
///
/// **Post-fire** (`Awaiting | Rebasing | Settling`): the actuator gate, then the *structural
/// mirror* of the pre-fire loop — `Settling ⇄ Rebasing` is `Batching ⇄ Verifying`, bounded by its
/// own [`CeilingState`] lifecycle (pre-fire's `(burst_deadline, forced)` analogue, collapsed into a
/// sum), over the *post-command* tree. The same fold floor ([`quiescence_verdict`]) computes the
/// post-fire verdict from the rebase response's `(authority, forced)` pair — `forced` projected
/// from [`CeilingState::Reached`] at the `profile_probe_gate` read — and no prior sample carries
/// across the fire. The pre-fire fields that encode a fire decision do not cross the boundary — the
/// typed [`PreFireBurst::into_post_fire`] move drops them, and the `BurstDeadline` timer becomes
/// structurally irrelevant ([`PostFireBurst::timer_token`] folds it to `None` for post-fire phases,
/// so the engine's stale-drain lazily collects the heap entry). Its one fresh accumulator is the
