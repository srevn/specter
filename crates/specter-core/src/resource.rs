//! `Resource` and friends.
//!
//! `Resource` lives inside `Tree`'s `SlotMap`. The structurally load-bearing fields (`parent`,
//! `segment`, `children`) are `pub(crate)`; `profiles` is module-private (the typed-mutator
//! paragraph below). Mutating any of them outside the routes that maintain the corresponding
//! indices corrupts the Tree. Cross-crate read access is via the accessor methods (`parent()`,
//! `children()`, `profiles()`); a slot's own segment string is read through [`crate::Tree::name`]
//! (no standalone `segment()` accessor — the key type is a Tree-internal detail).
//!
//! `kind` is `pub(crate)` — external read sites disagree on what `Unknown` means (pattern bypass vs
//! File-shape vs not-Dir). Forcing reads through [`Resource::kind`] (returns `Option<ResourceKind>`)
//! and [`Resource::kind_or_file`] (collapses Unknown to File-shape, the backend-mask convention)
//! makes that choice explicit at every call site. Writes go through [`crate::Tree::set_kind`].
//!
//! `contributions` is `pub(crate)` — every engine-side mutation flows through the typed methods on
//! `Resource` ([`Resource::insert_contribution`] / [`Resource::remove_contribution`] /
//! [`Resource::clear_contributions`]). The mutators return the edge information the refcount
//! helpers need (the prior mask on insert / remove, the prior count on `clear_*`), so the
//! 0↔non-empty emission decision sits at the engine helper layer without leaking the underlying
//! field shape. Read access for the demand summary goes through [`Resource::contributions`],
//! [`Resource::watch_demand`], [`Resource::events_union`].
//!
//! `proxy_promoters` is `pub(crate)` — a back-ref vector kept in lockstep with `Promoter.proxies`
//! (the engine's promoter side). A raw push / retain could desynchronise the two halves of that
//! join, so the sole mutators are the typed [`Resource::insert_proxy_promoter`] /
//! [`Resource::remove_proxy_promoter`]; each returns the empty ↔ non-empty retention-edge `bool`
//! (the same edge-reporting convention as the contributions mutators) and absorbs the dedup / no-op
//! guard internally. Read access is via [`Resource::proxy_promoters`]; the vector is also one of
//! the four structural claimants on [`Resource::has_anchors`].
//!
//! `profiles` is module-private — a back-ref vector kept in lockstep with `ProfileMap.by_resource`
//! (the engine's Profile side). A raw push / retain could desynchronise the two halves of that
//! join, so the sole mutators are the typed [`Resource::insert_profile_anchor`] /
//! [`Resource::remove_profile_anchor`]; each returns the empty ↔ non-empty retention-edge `bool`
//! (the same edge-reporting convention as the contributions / `proxy_promoters` mutators). Read
//! access is via [`Resource::profiles`]; the vector is also one of the four structural claimants on
//! [`Resource::has_anchors`].
//!
//! `role` is `pub`; the engine writes it directly. Role is metadata (no refcount edges), so a typed
//! setter would buy nothing.
