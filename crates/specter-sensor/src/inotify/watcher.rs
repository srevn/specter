//! `InotifyWatcher` — inotify-backed `FsWatcher` impl.
//!
//! Single-threaded: one thread owns the [`InotifyWatcher`] value and
//! drives [`FsWatcher::watch`] / [`FsWatcher::unwatch`] between
//! [`FsWatcher::poll_until`] calls. The wake handle
//! ([`InotifyWakeHandle`]) is the only cross-thread surface — see
//! [`crate::inotify::wake`] for the lifecycle discipline.
//!
//! Mirror of [`crate::kqueue::watcher::KqueueWatcher`] with the inotify
//! substrate (eventfd in place of `EVFILT_USER`, epoll multiplex over
//! `(inotify_fd, wake_fd)` in place of kqueue's single-fd kernel filter
//! set).
//!
//! # Drop semantics
//!
//! Default field-order drop:
//! - `inotify_fd` drops first → the kernel reaps every per-watch
//!   descriptor on this instance and queues the corresponding
//!   `IN_IGNORED` records (which no consumer reads; benign).
//! - `wake_fd` (`Arc`) decrements; if the last clone, the eventfd
//!   closes. Wake handles holding clones outlive the watcher and a
//!   `wake()` from those becomes a no-op-equivalent (no consumer
//!   drains the resulting counter), with no UB.
//! - `epoll_fd` drops last → the epoll instance closes; the kernel had
//!   already removed the inotify_fd / wake_fd registrations as those
//!   fds closed.
//!
//! # Per-resource entry cache
//!
//! Each entry caches `(wd, mask, kind)`: the watch descriptor returned
//! by `inotify_add_watch`, the kernel-side mask we last installed, and
//! the fstat-verified inode shape (established at fresh-watch time;
//! refreshed only on the slow path of [`InotifyWatcher::rewatch_inner`]
//! — see its docstring). The triple is stored as a single struct (not
//! three parallel maps keyed by `ResourceId`) so every install path
//! writes it atomically and every teardown clears it atomically — the
//! "forgot to update one of three maps" failure mode is
//! unrepresentable. Mirror of kqueue's `KqueueEntry { fd, fflags, kind }`.
//!
//! A re-`watch()` with an unchanged mask short-circuits without a
//! kernel install. The fast path (cached kind is `File` / `Dir`)
//! short-circuits with **zero syscalls** — the cache predicts the
//! install mask from `events × cached_kind` and the kernel's "replace
//! mask" semantics on an existing path would produce identical bits.
//! The slow path (cached kind is `Unknown`, the rare socket / fifo /
//! device case) reopens and `fstat`s before the short-circuit check
//! because the Unknown-collapse mask cannot be trusted to match the
//! live inode shape. See [`InotifyWatcher::rewatch_inner`].
