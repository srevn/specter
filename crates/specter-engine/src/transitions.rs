//! Per-input dispatch handlers.
//!
//! Each `on_*` method handles one [`Input`] variant for one Profile. They
//! call the burst-lifecycle helpers (`burst.rs`), the refcount edges
//! (`refcounts.rs`), and the reconciliation (`reconcile.rs`). Logic that
//! fits in one row of the transition table stays inline; logic shared across
//! rows (e.g., emit Effects on Standard stable verdict) is factored into
//! private helpers within this module.
//!
//! The match on `(intent, ProbeResult)` is the single dispatch site for the
//! post-probe state-transition chain — six rows, all reachable.
